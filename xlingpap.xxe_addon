><li
>Web page output when there is an associated publisher style sheet:<ul
><li
>Added an ignorePageWidthForWebPageOutput attribute to the pageLayout element of a publisher style sheet. If it is set to 'yes', then there is no fixed page width in the web page output (i.e. it "fills" the width like the web page output does when there is no associated publisher style sheet).</li

><li
>XeLaTeX way of producing PDF:<ul
><li
>Improvement: added a way to have any interlinear automatically wrap within the page width, including interlinear texts.</li
><li

><li
>Fix bug: when ISO codes were shown with interlinear and listInterlinear, the example number (and letter) were sometimes not horizontally aligned with the first line of the interlinear.</li
><li
>Fix bug: when a listInterlinear had a mix of ISO codes to show, any additional lineGroup elements also were incorrectly showing the ISO code.</li

><li
>In the 'Journal of the International Phonetic Association Illustration article, submission format' template, removed a XeLaTeXSpecial attribute for the consonant table; it was not needed and could cause the XeLaTeX way of producing PDF to fail if you added a column to the table.</li
><li
>Improved editor handling in publisher style sheets and reworked the IJAL, Language, and GIAL publisher style sheets.</li
><li

><li
>Add jIssueNumber to article references.</li
><li
>In an article reference, made the jPages or jArticleNumber be optional (with the advent of posting papers on the web, there are now some that do not use either; e.g. see <a

><li
>Made reference handling a bit easier in that when one wants to change a book to an article, say, one can now select the book element and then use the replace operation and one will get the usual template content for a new article element.</li
></ul
></li
><li
>New publisher style sheets enhancements:<ul
><li
>Ability to override langData, gloss, and interlinear free translation formatting per the style sheet. It also allows inserting text before or after each of these items (e.g. inserting quotes before and after the free translation).</li
><li
>Control whether or not a section number appears.</li
><li
>Control whether or not the initial paragraph of a section/chapter is indented.</li
><li
>Control where 'Ph.D. dissertation' and 'M.A. thesis' appear for dissertation and thesis reference layouts. (Note one must now add a dissertationLabelItem or thesisLabelItem in each reference 'pattern' or there will be a message that the pattern was not found.)</li
><li
>Improved process of matching for patterns in reference layouts (it was a bit sloppy before).</li
><li
>Improved notification for when a pattern in references was not found. It now tells you what the elements are that were not found.</li
><li
>Ability in the references layout section to put url and date accessed layout information under a common grouping (similar to what has been available for location and publisher layout information).</li
><li
>Added ability in the references layout section for location/publisher grouping and url/date accessed grouping to include a "missing" item. This greatly reduces the number of patterns needed to describe possible combinations.</li
></ul
></li
><li
>Improvements to abbreviations:<ul
><li
>For documents with an abbreviations master file that has more than one language, the abbreviation in the display in XXE will now show the abbreviation for the language specified in the abbreviationlang attribute of the lingPaper element.</li
><li
>When one adds a second language for an abbreviation (i.e. one inserts an abbrInLang element after an extant abbrInLang element), one can now use the SetReference command to set the language of the abbrInLang element. One can also use the SetReference command to change the language of any other abbrInLang element.</li

>XeLaTeX way of producing PDF:<ul
><li
>Front and back matter that are to be right-aligned per a publisher style sheet were still coming out left-aligned. Also improved centering.</li

>Added XeLaTeXSpecial command of column-formatting to allow one to override default table column formatting description. Note that this will probably only work well for simple tables.</li
><li
>Added two XeLaTeXSpecial commands for table cells: border-left and border-right; these add a vertical line to the left or right of the cell, respectively.</li
><li
>Fixed handling of tables so that if you use a width attribute in the first row, it will apply to all other rows as well unless the table has cells with colspan or rowspan attributes set.</li
><li
>Added check for .svg image files that have an equivalent .pdf form. If so, it will automatically use the .pdf file. This lets us see the image file in XXE. (XeLaTeX cannot format .svg, but it can format .pdf; XXE cannot display .pdf, but it can display .svg).</li
><li
>Fixed bug which caused a document to fail to produce PDF output with a style sheet whenever the style sheet forced an appendix title to upper case and the title was to be centered.</li
><li
>Fixed a bug in a table where an unwanted horizontal line was output (and also cause the heading material to not show). This could occur when the first cell of a table row was a th element with a rowspan attribute greater than 1.</li
><li
>Fixed bug where a br element within a listDefinition would cause it to fail to produce the PDF.</li
><li
>Fixed a bug where if a style sheet had a numberLayout for a section definition and that section does not begin a paragraph, the PDF would fail to be produced.</li
><li
>Fixed a bug where if a user had specified to use Graphite and also used a percentage-based font size, the Graphite processing failed to occur.</li
></ul
></li
><li
>Updated all provided publisher style sheets and XLingPaper "new file" templates to reflect changes in reference handling.</li
><li
>Fixed publisher style sheet bugs:<ul
><li

></li
><li
>2.10.0 24 March 2010<ul
><li
>Created full installers for Mac (OS X 10.4+) and Linux (tested on Ubuntu 8.04, 9.04, and 9.10).</li
><li
>Made the "produce Word 2003" process work with the full, GUI-based XMLmind XSL Utility product.</li
><li
>Made XeLaTeX way of producing PDF ignore blank p (paragraph) elements just like the web page and RenderX way of producing PDF do. Previously, the XeLaTeX way would show a blank line for every empty paragraph.</li
><li
>For publisher style sheet-based PDF output, if a refWork element does not have a matching pattern in the references layout portion of the publisher style sheet, we now output a message in the PDF. Previously, the content of the refWork element was silently left out completely.</li
><li
>PDF using publisher style sheet: a dissertation with a url element may not have shown in the output. Similarly for a proceedings element.</li
><li
>Allow br element in td, th, langData, and gloss for the XeLaTeX way of producing PDF.</li
><li
>Refined use of zero width spaces in URLs for the XeLaTeX way of producing PDF.</li
><li
>Fixed problem with orphaned section title in RenderX way of producing PDF (when using double spacing).</li
><li
>Improved method of changing the default lVernacular and lGloss language IDs. See section 11.27 "Change the lVernacular and lGloss language IDs" in the user documentation.</li
><li
>Added warning checks for incomplete href attributes in link elements, src attributes in img elements, and citename and name attributes in refAuthor elements.</li
><li
>Producing PDF via XeLaTeX failed when a table cell had the XeLaTeXSpecial attribute containing a valign-fixup value and there was no rowspan</li
><li
>Allow zero width spaces in URLs so the PDF formatters can break the URLs at ends of lines.</li
><li
>Fix bug in PDF outputs: a section[1-6] element had a type attribute, but it was being ignored.</li
><li
>Enhance publisher style sheet output to control whether the hundreds digit in the second part of a page range should be output or not. For example, should 158-183 be output as "158-83" or as "158-183"?</li
></ul
></li
><li
>2.9.0 29 January 2010<ul
><li
>Add a section in the user documentation on how to produce a talk handout.</li
><li
>Add section in user documentation on how to insert a sectionN when in a sectionN+1.</li
><li
>Refined the "About XLingPaper" page.</li
><li
>In web page output, add extra space between consecutive examples.</li
><li
>Refined the Choose Font Dialog:<ul
><li
>It now knows about using default values for font-family, font-size, font-style, and font-weight.</li
><li
>The font-size can now be a percentage.</li
><li
>In fact, the font-size defaults to being a percentage.</li
></ul
></li
><li
>Refined the "Associate a publisher style sheet" process to:<ul
><li
>Use a regular file chooser dialog (instead of the special one used before).</li
><li
>Keep any referenced documents (the old way lost the referencing).</li
><li
>Make the path to the publisher style sheet be relative to the document being edited.</li
><li
>Check to make the sure the file is indeed a publisher style sheet.</li
><li
>Check to make sure the file is actually there.</li
><li
>Removed the Shift-F9 keyboard short-cut (this command is not used enough to warrant a keyboard short-cut).</li
></ul
></li
><li
>Added a "Remove (unassociate) a publisher style sheet" command.</li
><li
>Refined the checking for missing fonts and/or image files before trying to produce PDF. It now shows a dialog box you can use to quickly find the places where the problems are.</li
><li
>Fixed the 'convert abbreviations in gloss to abbrRefs' commands so <ul
><li
>they will find person numbers (1, 2, or 3) before other abbreviations (such as number or gender);</li
><li
>they will also use periods, underscores, semi-colons, colons, backslashes, square brackets and parentheses as delimiters when looking for abbreviations;</li
></ul
></li
></ul
><ul
><li
>Fixed 'Convert any abbreviations in gloss to abbrRefs' command so it will apply even when there are other elements within the gloss (such as object elements or abbrRef elements).</li
><li
>When you overtly save a file, if any of the endnote elements still have just a simple "n" for their id or if any refWork elements still have just a simple "r" for their id, a unique id will now automatically be assigned. You can change these at any time by editing the id attribute in the endnote or refWork element.</li
><li
>Added new element: interlinearRefCitation. It can occur anywhere other ref items appear. It refers to an interlinear within an interlinear text included in the document (usually in an appendix). In the output, it displays the short name of the text and the line number in that text of the referred to interlinear.</li
><li
>Refine the interlinearRefCitation element to allow control of the presence of the square brackets and the text-name-colon. Also have the interlinearRefCitation appear in XXE like it will in the output.</li
><li
>Have the 'Insert and then Set Reference' command include the interlinearRefCitation element.</li
><li
>Fix bug which made the Set Reference chooser dialog show garbage if the material that it was trying to show contained a double quote.</li
><li
>Made the installer so that XXE will automatically show the Validity tool upon save if there are any errors/warnings.</li
><li
>Fixed bug which allowed a citation occurring inside a comment element to cause an entry to show in the references.</li
><li
>Add a semantic integrity check for long tables that do not have the makings of a header.</li
><li
>Fix a bug: an example reference to an example within an endnote/footnote did not use the roman numeral for the example it referred to.</li
><li
>Fixed some bugs in the XeLaTeX way of producing PDF:<ul
><li
>Examples in tables would fail to produce the PDF.</li
><li
>free elements did not pay attention to font information (other than font-family).</li
><li
>If a date or presentedAt element ended in a br element, the PDF failed to be produced.</li
><li
>If a table with lines was embedded in another table with lines, the PDF failed to be produced.</li
><li
>If a file name contained spaces, it did not always correctly recognize the first time the file was being processed.</li
><li
>If the file name contained parentheses, the process to produce PDF might hang.</li
><li
>If the file name contained non-ASCII characters, the process to produce PDF might fail.</li
><li
>If a publisher style sheet said an item was to start on an odd page and also that the item should space down from the top, it did not always space down.</li
></ul
></li
><li
>Fixed some bugs with the RenderX way of producing PDF:<ul
><li
>An empty colspan attribute in a table cell would prevent the PDF from being produced.</li
><li
>An empty rowspan attribute in a table cell would prevent the PDF from being produced.</li
><li
>An initial table row that began with some th elements but also had some td elements would prevent the PDF from being produced.</li
><li
>Showing the list of abbreviations as a table when there were no abbreviations to show would prevent the PDF from being produced.</li
><li
>No longer try to use an xsl-foSpecial attribute that does not have an equal sign in it.</li
></ul
></li
></ul
></li
><li
>2.8.0 18 December 2009<ul
><li
>Added an "About XLingPaper" page (In XLingPaper menu item).</li
><li
>Added a command to convert text material in a gloss to their corresponding abbreviation (i.e. abbrRef elements).</li
><li
>Enhanced the "Convert interlinear line to wrd elements" command to also automatically convert abbreviations to abbrRef elements (in gloss elements only, and only when one has abbreviations).</li
><li
>Added more integrity checks for "semantic" conditions (such as incorrect number of langData elements within a line element).</li
><li
>Made the Produce Word Document work with the newly released version of the XMLmind XSL-FO Converter (version 4.3.2).</li
><li
>Allow an abbreviation reference (abbrRef element) to appear within a genericRef element and also within an object element.</li
><li
>Fix a bug where if you use the mouse to set an exampleRef, sometimes the output would not have the example number. The fix occurs whenever you save your file.</li
><li
>Fixed bug in web transform which failed to show a background color in a table cell when the td or th element referred to a type element that had the background color.</li
><li
>Added align attribute to the table element. It has values of "left", "center", and "right". The default is "left". This attribute makes no difference for the RenderX way of producing PDF (because RenderX has no way to implement it). It only works in tables which are not in examples.</li
><li
>Added two special attributes for the XeLaTeX way of producing PDF to add a (horizontal) line before and/or after a row in a table. To use this, in a tr element, add 'linebefore' or 'lineafter' to the XeLaTeXSpecial attribute.</li
><li
>Fixed some bugs in the XeLaTeX way of producing PDF: <ul
><li
>Superscript and subscript type elements were missing the XeLaTeXSpecial attributes (the words superscript and subscript, respectively) so superscript and subscript did not work.</li
><li
>Added needed space between listInterlinears and embedded (or continuation) interlinear lines.</li
><li
>There was no way to add an underline via a type element. Fixed it by adding the key word underline to XeLaTeXSpecial).</li
><li
>A table containing a cell with both a rowspan and colspan did not properly align some following cells.</li
><li
>A table containing a cell with both a rowspan and colspan did not properly center the content if valign='middle'.</li
><li
>For table cells (td and th), added ability to set XeLaTeXSpecial attribute valign-fixup to fine-tune the vertical alignment when needed (e.g. valign-fixup='-1.25ex').</li
><li
>A table containing a cell with a rowspan and a width attribute did not pay attention to the width attribute.</li
><li
>A table containing multiple cells with a rowspan did not always properly align the columns.</li
><li
>A table containing a cell with both a colspan and a width in the first row produced wrong results.</li
><li
>When using a publisher style sheet where the interlinear source is to appear after the first line, the PDF failed to be produced.</li
><li
>In an interlinear, when a free element was followed by a lineGroup element, it did not always format correctly.</li
><li
>Embedded lists did not always align properly.</li
><li
>An endnote within a list would use the indent of the list instead of starting at the left edge.</li
><li
>When an abbrRef element was within either a wrd element or a gloss element, any font attributes of the wrd or gloss element were not applying to the content of the abbreviation.</li
><li
>When using a publisher style sheet and that style sheet did not use special formatting for a section number, there was no space between the section number and the section title.</li
><li
>When a line element had multiple gloss elements or multiple langData elements, the processing could fail.</li
><li
>When a table cell (td or th element) had a backgroundcolor attribute set to 0, no PDF would be produced.</li
><li
>An abbrRef element always used the default font even when it was within an object or a gloss element that had a different font.</li
><li
>If one has a graphic file name containing an apostrophe and that file was not found, no PDF would be produced (and no warning message either!).</li
><li
>When an endnote within a table cell had a paragraph followed by a table, sometimes no PDF would be produced.</li
><li
>A long ordered list might fail to produce the PDF.</li
></ul
></li
><li
>Fixed some bugs in the RenderX way of producing PDF output:<ul
><li
>A short endnote would be incorrectly formatted justified across the width of the page whenever the endnote was within a free translation that was part of an interlinear that had an interlinearSource element.</li
><li
>If one was showing abbreviations as a table and there were no abbreviations in the file, the PDF failed to be produced.</li
></ul
></li
><li
>Fixed some bugs in both PDF output formats:<ul
><li
>An endnote element within a langData (or gloss) element would use the font information of the langData element instead of the default font information.</li
><li
>When using a publisher style sheet with only one author description and the paper/book had multiple authors, the second and beyond authors did not format per the author description.</li
></ul
></li
><li
>Improved web page output:<ul
><li
>Increased spacing between an exampleHeader and a table.</li
><li
>Increased spacing between listInterlinears.</li
><li
>Increased spacing between nested interlinears.</li
><li
>Make abbrRef elements use color and font attributes of their enclosing gloss and object elements. No underline is normally shown, even though it is still a link.</li
><li
>If a dissertation or thesis reference had an institution, the institution name was not followed by a period. This is fixed.</li
><li
>When viewed in Internet Explorer, sometimes words in small-caps would be raised a bit higher than the rest of the line (in interlinear). Made a change to try and improve this.</li
></ul
></li
></ul
></li
><li
>2.7.2 12 October 2009<ul
><li
>Improved vertical spacing around examples in the XeLaTeX way of producing PDF.</li
><li
>Significantly Improved vertical spacing around titles, chapters, and section titles in the XeLaTeX way of producing PDF.</li
><li
>Removed unnecessary message which popped up when changing language font information.</li
><li
>Made SIL International publisher style sheets use correct font size and style in headers and footers.</li
><li
>Fixed bug which failed to show multiple glossaries in both the web page output and also in the "canned" RenderX way of producing PDF.</li
><li
>Fixed bugs that made the XeLaTeX way of producing PDF fail whenever a publisher style sheet had<ul
><li
>sections that began a paragraph<br
/></li
><li
>interlinear source show underneath the free translation (and a given interlinear did not have any interlinear source element)</li
><li
>an abstract (and the abstract was indented)</li
><li
>special font formatting for sectionRef elements</li
></ul
></li
><li
>Slightly modified the default IJAL publisher style sheets and the Language publisher style sheet.</li
><li
>Made the XeLaTeX way of producing PDF use "left justified" in table cells where the width attribute was set (it was still justifying the content which caused gaps to appear).</li
><li
>Fixed bugs that made the XeLaTeX way of producing PDF via a book publisher style sheet <ul
><li
>not always have the hyperlink to frontmatter table of contents items be on the correct page</li
><li
>not have the hyperlink to the references be on the correct page</li
></ul
></li
></ul
></li
><li
>2.7.1 30-September 2009<ul
><li
>Improved the listing of possible elements to insert (that is, the list that shows up in the Element Editor). Now short element names (e.g. "pc") also have a version that includes a fuller description (e.g. "pc(paragraph_continuation)").</li
><li
>Improved the notification process for when the file you are trying to produce (PDF, Word, or web page) is being used by another program. It no longer has an odd error message, just a meaningful dialog box.</li
><li
>Fixed a bug that made the "Produce PDF" process not work if the document was on a drive other than C:.</li
><li
>Fixed a bug that made the "Produce PDF" process not work if the document was located on the root or top directory of a drive.</li
><li
>Fixed the "Produce PDF" process to now work if your computer did not already have certain system files (msvcp71.dll and msvcr71.dll).</li
><li
>Fixed a bug in the XeLaTeX way of producing a PDF file that caused it to fail if an interlinear had two lineGroup elements in a row.</li
><li
>Fixed a bug that incorrectly aligned a second free translation within an interlinear if one had a sequence of "lineGroup, free, lineGroup, free" in that interlinear.</li
><li
>Made the included IJAL submission publisher style sheet show contents, block quotes, examples, references, and table be single spaced while the rest is double spaced.</li
></ul
></li
><li
>2.7.0 18-September 2009<ul
><li
>Made to work on computers running Unix and Mac (OS X) operating systems (Unix tested only on Ubuntu 8.4.0 and 9.4.0).</li
><li
>Unix and Mac versions do not yet work with the XeLaTeX way of producing PDF output. You will need to use the RenderX way.</li
><li
>When you overtly save a file, if any of the examples still have just a simple "x" for their id, a unique id will now automatically be assigned. You can change these at any time by editing the id attribute in the example.</li
><li
>Fixed RenderX PDF to pay attention to singlespace options when the document is double or space-and-half (via a style sheet).</li
><li
>Fixed RenderX PDF to properly format more than one preface in a book.</li
></ul
></li
><li
>2.6.0 13-August-2009<ul
><li
>Created an installation package to make installation much, much simpler.</li
><li
>This package includes a second, new way to produce PDF output; see section 11.17 'Produce a PDF Version' in the user documentation file.</li
><li
>It now will tell you what to do when you try to produce a PDF file (via the RenderX XEP tool) and you do not yet have that tool installed.</li
><li
>It will now tell you what to do when you try to produce a Word 2003 document and you do not yet have the XMLmind XSL-FO Converter tool installed.</li
><li
>It will now automatically show a PDF or Word file after it has been produced.</li
><li
>Refined the "grammar" for table rows. It used to allow any combination of td (regular cell) elements and th (header) elements. Now a table row is more restrictive:<ul
><li
>The entire row must have only th elements or</li
><li
>The entire row must have only td elements or</li
><li
>The beginning (left) of the row can have one or more th elements followed by all td elements.</li
></ul
></li
><li
>The reason for this change is that table headers should only be at the top or along the left side. The rows at the top will get carried over to the next page when a long table is split across page boundaries. To fix a table you may have that is now considered to be ill-formed, do this:<ul
><li
>For each bad th element in the table, click on the th element in the XPath Bar, click the Convert icon in the Edit Pane and choose td. This will keep the content of the cell whle changing it from th to td.</li
><li
>If you had used a th element in order to make the cell content come out bold, select the cell content and then click on the Convert icon in the Edit pane and choose object. Then press F11 and choose a type that produces bold.</li
></ul
></li
><li
>There is a new menu item that lets you convert .svg files to .pdf files (since the new way of producing PDF files does not handle .svg files, but does handle embedded .pdf files).</li
><li
>Let a glossary element have a type attribute.</li
><li
>Allow type attributes in back matter element titles.</li
><li
>Fix a bug in handling chapters via a publisher style sheet.</li
></ul
></li
><li
>2.5.1 21-May-2009<ul
><li
>Made the langData, gloss, object, and wrd elements show in XXE as they will appear in the output. This is now possible because of a bug fix in XXE version 4.3.0.</li
><li
>Fix bug in "Convert interlinear line to wrd elements" process.</li
><li
>The book element no longer requires location and publisher. These are now optional.</li
><li
>Fix bug in handling an endnote in a section title when producing the table of contents in web page output.</li
><li
>Fix some bugs in handling exampleHeadings in web page output.</li
><li
>Fix some bugs in handling of interlinear text references.</li
><li
>Fix bug in displaying interlinear source in output.</li
><li
>Fix bug so that now the endnote number is shown in a smaller size in the web page output.</li
><li
>Improve PDF "bookmark" formatting in PDF output.</li
><li
>Added "variantTypes" to type attribute of the item element</li
><li
>Added width attribute to both td and th elements.</li
><li
>Added background color attribute to many elements</li
><li
>Added bVol and seriesItem elements to collectionLayout so these can show in output using a stylesheet.</li
></ul
></li
><li
>2.5.0 23-Feb-2009<ul
><li
>Make work (partly) on a Mac. PDF output does not work yet.</li
><li
>Fix "Convert interlinear line to wrd elements" command to use the lang attribute of the original langData or gloss element for all the resulting wrd elements (and not just the last one)</li
><li
>Fix bug which failed to show small caps in Mocrosoft Word output</li
><li
>Fix bug in displaying and formatting bVol element in references.</li
><li
>Fix bug in formatting exampleHeading in list examples.</li
><li
>Fix bug in formatting multiple glossary elements in a paper associated with a stylesheet.</li
><li
>Fix bug in formatting interlinear text reference in a paper associated with a stylesheet</li
><li
>Fix bug in formatting appendix letter in a paper associated with a stylesheet</li
><li
>Fix bug in formatting section number when there is only one section in a paper associated with a stylesheet</li
></ul
></li
><li
>2.4.0 24-January-2009<ul
><li
>Make work with XMLmind XML Editor (XXE) version 4.2.0 or earlier</li
><li
>Had to stop showing the langData, gloss, and object elements as they will appear in the output. It made XXE load large files extremely slowly. Plans are to try a different way to achieve this that does not slow down XXE.</li
><li
>Allow table elements (including rows and cells) to have a background color attribute</li
><li
>Reworked how promote and demote sections was done since sometimes it failed to run</li
><li
>Allow interlinearSource element in a listInterlinear</li
><li
>Added fieldNotes as a new kind of refWork element</li
><li
>In PDF output, if there are no chapters and there is but one section1 (with no subsections), no section number is produced</li
><li
>Fixed bug that incorrectly indented a second free translation line in an interlinear when the second line was for a different language than the first line</li
><li
>Fixed bug with interlinearRef that sometimes showed more than one instance of the interlinear</li
><li
>Some improvements to publisher stylesheet information and handling</li
></ul
></li
><li
>2.3.0 7-October-2008<ul
><li
>The langData, gloss, and object elements now display in the XXE editor as they will appear in the output. They used to show in a pre-canned color, using a generic font. Now they use the appropriate font, color, size, italic, bold, etc.</li
><li
>Added the ability to gloss language data using a standard set of abbreviations. Just like one can create and maintain a master references list, now one can do the same for abbreviations. XLingPaper also creates a hyperlink between the abbreviation in the gloss and the abbreviation where it is defined. See section 4.6 in the user documentation.</li
><li
>Added ability for examples to have a heading (or label or description or whatever you want to call it). See section 5.8 iin the user documentation.</li
><li
>Added a shorter way to insert reference elements and assign them to their value (e.g. sectionRef, exampleRef, citation, object, etc.). See section 12.9 in the user documentation.</li
><li
>Added a genericTarget element so one can use the genericRef element to create a hyperlink to almost any place in the document. See footnote [37] in section 10.2 in the user documentation.</li
><li
>Added a book volume number element (bVol) for references. See section 4.5.2 in the user documentation.</li
><li
>Removed the requirement that a collection have an editor (collEd element). See section 4.5.3 in the user documentation.</li
><li
>Added a way to control the text that occurs before a sectionRef (some publications like to use the Â§ symbol while others do not). See section 3.3.1 in the user documentation.</li
><li
>The interlinear free translation element can now be associated with a language.</li
><li
>Added the ability to include ISO 639-3 codes to a refWork element to indicate which languages the work is about. See section 4.5 in the user documentation.</li
><li
>Added a way to have the ISO 639-3 code appear in an interlinear example (this is an undocumented ability: set the showiso639-3codeininterlinear attribute to 'yes' in the lingPaper element).</li
><li
>Added start-up documents for languages and for types, so one can maintain a master list of these, if one so wishes.</li
><li
>Improved the way section numbering shows in Appendices within the XMLmind XML Editor.</li
><li
>Fixed "l_free" element templates to show up in embedded places as well as at the example level.</li
><li
>Fixed the webpage transform to better handle list interlinears, especially in endnotes (where the old way would cause all following endnotes to place the endnote text on a separate line from the number).</li
><li
>Added a number of improvements for publisher style sheets, including:<ul
><li
>Added ability to create PDF bookmarks in a styled PDF output.</li
><li
>Improved appendix layout</li
><li
>Better control over table of contents</li
><li
>Added ability to control hyperlink color and underline for individual link elements</li
></ul
></li
></ul
></li
><li
>2.2.0 12-May-2008<ul
><li
>Added interlinearRef element. One uses this in an example to refer to a portion of an interlinear text (which is probably in an appendix). When formatted for output, the interlinear portion is shown in the example along with a link to the portion in the interlinear-text proper.</li
><li
>Allow one to put examples in the cells of a (non-example) table. This allows one to put small width examples side-by-side.</li
><li
>Added a menu option to automatically convert space-separated interlinear lines to "wrd" element lines. One can now type or copy-and-paste interlinear, use this menu option, and then highlight portions of the interlinear as appropriate to the context of your discussion.</li
><li
>Added new element templates for tables with both header rows and an initial header column</li
><li
>Added new element templates for interlinear that is just language data and free translation.</li
><li
>Added a type attribute to the appendix element so one may now do special formatting for an appendix like one can do for part, chapter, section1, section2, etc. elements.</li
><li
>Added a period after the appendix letter in the standard web page and PDF transforms.</li
><li
>For PDF produced via a publisher style sheet, added a way to insert some vertical space before a main section in the table of contents.</li
><li
>Fixed a bug which failed to show (within the XMLmind XML Editor) the textref information in a listInterlinear (it was showing fine in a regular interlinear).</li
><li
>Fixed a bug which failed to show (within the XMLmind XML Editor) a header cell's align attribute.</li
><li
>Fixed a bug in the PDF output which failed to properly span rows in a table.</li
><li
>Fixed a bug in the PDF output which failed to properly pay attention to a table cell's valign attribute..</li
><li
>Fixed a bug in the publisher style sheet PDF output which caused the transform to abort if one had glossaryLayout information. It now formats the glossary properly.</li
><li
>Fixed a bug in the publisher style sheet PDF output: when using paperAuthor for a header or footer in a style sheet when there were 2 or more authors, it used to merely place one author after the other without any intervening space or punctuation. Now it creates a list: it inserts " and " before the last one and inserts ", " between any other two authors.</li
></ul
></li
><li
>2.1.0 14-Mar-2008<ul
><li
>Added capability to relatively easily split portions of a section into sub-sections (i.e. demote the portions).</li

></li
><li
>2.0.1 10-Mar-2008: <ul
><li
>Fix bug in web page transform which caused some publisher style sheet information to appear at the bottom of the page</li

>Fix bug in handling of paperAuthor in headers or footers (came out stretched across the header)</li
><li
>Add emphasis type to all new document templates.</li
