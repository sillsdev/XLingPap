><secTitle
>Introduction</secTitle
><p
>The <object
type="tXLingPap"
></object
> package is designed to aid the linguist in writing linguistic documents such as papers, books, theses, and dissertations.</p
><p
>Linguists commonly face three obstacles in formatting papers. First, all examples are numbered in a paper. If during the writing process the author discovers a need to insert an example, then the numbering of all following examples and all references to those examples within the text need to be re-adjusted. This mechanical change can be both time-consuming and prone to error. Similarly, if the author decides to reorder some examples, then the numbering needs to be adjusted appropriately. <object
type="tXLingPap"
></object
> provides an automatic way to facilitate such numbering and renumbering.</p
><p
>Secondly, linguists cite the work of other researchers using a standard citation format. This format functions essentially as an abbreviation or reference to the full citation entry which appears in the references section of the paper. The burden of maintaining consistency between citation and reference typically falls totally on the author. Many a reader has been disappointed to find a citation to a paper in the body of a paper for which there is no entry in the references section. <object
type="tXLingPap"
></object
> provides an automatic means for a writer to maintain consistency; all citations in the text must have a corresponding entry in the references. Conversely, <object
type="tXLingPap"
></object
> will include only those entries in the references section which are cited in the text. This latter characteristic implies that one can maintain one master list of references and merely include it in any given paper. Only those references actually cited in the given paper will appear in the references section.</p
><p
>Thirdly, linguists commonly use a set of abbreviations while glossing examples. They usually include either a list of the abbreviations and their definitions in a footnote, in a special front-matter page, or in a back-matter page. As for citations and references, the burden of maintaining consistency between the abbreviations used in the text and the abbreviations defined in the list typically falls totally on the author. Many a reader has been disappointed to find an abbreviation in a gloss for which there is no corresponding entry in the list of abbreviations. <object
type="tXLingPap"
></object
> provides an automatic means for a writer to maintain consistency; the author can make it so all abbreviations in the text must have a corresponding entry in the list of abbreviations. Conversely, <object
type="tXLingPap"
></object
> will include only those abbreviations in the list of abbreviations which are actually used in the text. This latter characteristic implies that one can maintain one master list of abbreviations and merely include it in any given paper. Only those abbreviations actually cited in the given paper will appear in the list of abbreviations. By the way, <object
type="tXLingPap"
></object
> also creates a hyperlink between the abbreviation in the text and the abbreviation in the list of abbreviations. Thus, a reader can click on the abbreviation and see what it means.</p
><p
>In addition, in some formatting systems such as HTML, headers (i.e. <object
type="tElement"
>h1</object
>, <object
type="tElement"
>h2</object
>, etc.) are not automatically numbered. <object
type="tXLingPap"
></object
> will automatically number all parts, chapters, and sections. Furthermore, one may create references to parts, chapters, or sections and these will display as hyperlinks to them, using the appropriate number.</p
><p
>Since <object
type="tXLingPap"
></object
> is in XML, it also can serve as an archiving format.</p

><p
>This section provides an overview of how to use <object
type="tXLingPap"
></object
> with the <object
type="tXMLmindXMLEditor"
></object

><p
>The first consists of entering the appropriate element tags into an XML document. That is, the writer needs to key the correct tags in the file(s) to enable <object
type="tXLingPap"
></object
> to recognize them. This document describes how one can do this using the <object
type="tXMLmindXMLEditor"
></object

> for other ways one can do this.</p
><p
>The second step in using <object
type="tXLingPap"
></object
> is to process the document file(s) to show the output in some form. Currently there are ways to produce these kinds of outputs:</p

type="tElement"
>example</object
> element packages (see section <sectionRef
sec="sExamples"
></sectionRef
>) and typed in what you need in the example, you have to do something special to continue on with another paragraph. To get a following paragraph, you will need to select the entire <object
type="tElement"
>example</object
> element and then do an <object
type="tInstruction"
>Insert After</object
> command. You will then see that one of the options is a <object
type="tElement"
>p</object
> element (for paragraph). Choose the <object
type="tElement"
>p</object

><p
><indexedItem
term="iAttributeTool"
></indexedItem
>When an element has some attributes that need to be set, one will see these in the Attributes tool. For example, suppose you have just entered a citation to a book (see section <sectionRef

>One of the things that can make using the <object
type="tXMLmindXMLEditor"
></object
> a bit different from using other editors, is that when one enters such an element while typing a paragraph, say, one will find that the new element has been inserted as illustrated in <exampleRef
num="xNewPaperAttributesTool"
></exampleRef
>, but one cannot seem to type beyond the recently inserted element. The trick to learn is to type the <object
type="tKey"
>Insert</object

>Since Macs do not have an <object
type="tKey"
>Insert</object

>Notice that for Bauer &amp; Warren (2004) and for Sampson (1987), the reference entry itself contains the information about the collection volume (i.e. the book) the paper occurs in. For Barry (1992) and Browman &amp; Goldstein (1992), however, the reference entry refers to another reference entry for the collection: Docherty &amp; Ladd (1992).</p
><p
>Why should some collection entries have the full information about the collection volume while others merely refer to the collection volume which is a distinct entry itself? The key difference is that when two or more papers from the same collection volume are cited, then for those papers, we need to refer to the collection volume itself instead of spelling out the collection volume information.</p
><p
>It is possible within <object
type="tXLingPap"
></object

type="tElement"
>collCitation</object
> element to refer to the collection volume (which will use a <object
type="tElement"
>book</object

Kaisse, eds. &lt;i&gt;Phonetics and Phonology&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p style="padding-left:0.25in"&gt;It is argued that morpheme subcategorization &amp;amp; phonological rules are both biplanar, in that both must occasionally cite prosodic &amp;amp; morphological criteria. Polish comparative &amp;amp; imperative allomorphy requires reference to an extrasyllabic consonant; biplanar phonological rules include the final syllable extrametricality of English adjectives, the Dutch compound stress rule, &amp;amp; German schwa insertion in nouns. Biplanar subcategorization, as exemplified by Yidiny nominal reduplication, analyzed as a minimal-word affix attaching simultaneously to a minimal word &amp;amp; a noun, is applied to a solution of a classical problem of reduplication in Tagalog; it is argued that what has been seen as a head operation is really affixation to a prosodic constituent. Biplanarity provides a natural solution to English bracketing paradoxes &amp;amp; permits a typological distinction between clitics &amp;amp; affixes: clitics have only prosodic subcategorization, whereas affix subcategorization is biplanar. 41 References.

It is shown that neither the standard theory of reduplication nor prosody-based theories can account for the general problem of melodic transfer. Contrary to A. Marantz's (1982) concatenative account, the alternative theory is based on the assumption of a nonconcatenative word formation process in the sense of J. McCarthy (1981). It proposes four steps: affixation, reduplication, transfer (as opposed to copying), &amp;amp; sequencing. The four-step procedure is illustrated with data from Agta, Klamath (Penutian), Tagalog, &amp;amp; Ponapean. Problems related to rule overapplication, language-specific reduplication processes, &amp;amp; the involvement of higher-level prosodic units are addressed. 29 References. C.

Past analyses have sought to explain the occurrence of fusion, assuming without exception that the conditioning environment is morphological. I consider such approaches wrongheaded on two counts. I suggest the question to ask is not why fusion occurs where it does but why it does not occur elsewhere. I show, then, that the answer to this question lies unquestionably in consideration of prosody, not morphology. Crucially, I claim that the demand for feature recoverability interacts with the prosodic specifications of the language. Fusion is the combined result of licensing of the features of a potential coda segment, and an opposing pressure for dependent foot syllables to be as light as possible. By contrast, in head foot syllables, the unmarked syllable is a closed one. While seeking independent support in the language for this analysis, I find evidence that, far from demanding special treatment, fusion is more appropriately seen as a natural impulse in the language, one of many segmental changes that occur in response to head-dependent asymmetries at the word prosodic level. Within my description of the parameters of fusion, all data relevant to the process that have hitherto been cited as exceptions are, instead, predictable. &lt;/p&gt;</chart

href="http://www.eva.mpg.de/lingua/resources/glossing-rules.php"
>http://www.eva.mpg.de/lingua/resources/glossing-rules.php</link
> on October 1, 2008. The only difference between them is whether the abbreviations are in all capital letters or all lower case letters. If you plan to use small caps for your abbreviations, then use the one with lower case letters. To start such a list, do this:</p

><ol
><li
>Make sure that every abbreviation is in lower case (please recall that small caps only work on lower case letters; if you apply small caps to an upper case letter, it remains unchanged). If you need a portion of the abbreviation to remain lower case (and not be shown in small caps), you can insert an <object
type="tElement"
>object</object
> element and put that portion in it. Set the <object
type="tAttribute"
>type</object

type="tElement"
>type</object
> element which uses a normal font.</li
><li
>The next step depends on whether or not you have a true small caps font. <ul
><li
>If you have a true small caps font, set the <object
type="tAttribute"
>font-family</object
> attribute of the <object
type="tElement"
>abbreviations</object

type="tAttrValue"
>Charis SIL Small Caps</object

>Please note that since this method uses the punctuation symbols listed in example <exampleRef
letter="xLeipzigPunctuationDelimiters"
num="xLeipzigPunctuationDelimiters"
></exampleRef
> to separate potential abbreviation labels, if you have any abbreviations which contain any of these symbols, this method will not find those abbreviations. That is, this method (and from what I can tell, the <link
href="http://www.eva.mpg.de/lingua/resources/glossing-rules.php"
>Leipzig glossing conventions</link
>) assume that your list of abbreviations will not have combinations like this. Rather, you list just the component pieces. For example, rather than having a single abbreviation entry like “dat.pl”, you will have two entries: one for “dat” and one for “pl”. You can, of course, still have a combination abbreviation, but you will need to create the <object
type="tElement"
>abbrRef</object
> element for it by hand (as mentioned in section <sectionRef
sec="sBMAbbreviationsReferencesManual"
></sectionRef
>). You cannot use this short-cut method.<endnote
id="nSpecialPeriod"
><p
>There is a trick you can use to get the automated method to not split an abbreviation at (what appear to be) periods. You do this by not keying periods in the <object
type="tElement"
>abbrTerm</object
> element, but rather a “one dot leader” character (Unicode 0x2024). It looks like this:․ (that is, it looks exactly like a period but is not). Note that some fonts may not have a glyph for this Unicode code point.</p
></endnote
></p
><p
>In addition, this method cannot recognize any word or abbreviation that contains an apostrophe character ( ' ). If you have an abbreviation that uses an apostrophe, you will need to create the <object
type="tElement"
>abbrRef</object
> element by hand.</p
><p
>Further, note that if your master list of abbreviations include abbreviations for more than one language and if you have set the <object
type="tAttribute"
>abbreviationlang</object
> attribute of the <object
type="tElement"
>lingPaper</object
> element to a particular language code (see section <sectionRef
sec="sBMAbbreviationsMasterListMultipleLanguages"
></sectionRef
>), then this easier method will only find abbreviations which are overtly marked to be for that language code.</p
><p
>In addition, please be aware that it is important to make use of the <object
type="tElement"
>wrd</object
> elements when using this short-cut method with interlinear examples (see section <sectionRef
sec="sExInterlinearWrd"
></sectionRef
>). If you just use the plain text approach as described in section <sectionRef

>If you wish, you can create a list of glossary terms used throughout your document. Just like references and citations, the idea here is that while the list of glossary terms can be large, <object
type="tXLingPap"
></object
> will only show those that are actually used somewhere within the document. You can thus maintain a file that is just the list of glossary terms (and their definitions), include it in your document, and then, while writing, make a reference to a glossary term in the list. Besides only including glossary terms actually used somewhere in the document, <object
type="tXLingPap"
></object
> will also create a hyperlink between the glossary term in the text and the actual glossary term in the list of glossary terms. Of course, the list will also include the definition of the glossary term.</p
><p
>This master list of glossary terms can also be in multiple languages. So if you typically write your papers in either English or Spanish, say, you can maintain the list of glossary terms in both languages. For a given paper, you indicate which language to use by setting the <object
type="tAttribute"
>glossarytermlang</object
> attribute of the main <object
type="tElement"
>lingPaper</object
> element. To find this attribute, click on <object
type="tInstruction"

></endnoteRef
> and then use the Attributes Tool<endnoteRef
note="nAttributesToolReminder"

>glossarytermlang</object

> elements in your document (e.g. <object
type="tAttrValue"
>en</object
> for English, <object
type="tAttrValue"
>es</object
> for Spanish, or <object
type="tAttrValue"
>fr</object
> for French). If you do not set this attribute, then the first glossary term item found will be used. Also, if you inadvertently do not have a glossary term for the language you selected, but you do have one for another language, then the first glossary term found will be used, too. See section <sectionRef

> and then immediately press the <object
type="tInstruction"
>F11</object
> key on your keyboard (or use menu items <object
type="tInstruction"
>XLingPaper / Set Reference F11</object
>), a dialog box will pop up that lists all the language identifiers in your paper. You can then select the one that is correct for this glossary term.</p
></endnote
> Naturally, when you refer to a glossary term for phrase in your document, you'll want to use 'frase' in Spanish and 'phrase' in English. Then, when you mark a given document's <object
type="tAttribute"
>glossarytermlang</object
> attribute (in the <object
type="tElement"
>lingPaper</object
> element) to be <object
type="tAttrValue"
>en</object
> for English, <object
type="tXLingPap"
></object
> will use the English glossary term for those glossary terms with two or more <object
type="tElement"
>glossaryTermInLang</object
> elements. If you mark the document to be <object
type="tAttrValue"
>es</object
> for Spanish, then <object
type="tXLingPap"

>glossaryTermInLang</object
> information. For those glossary terms that have only one <object
type="tElement"
>glossaryTermInLang</object
> element, that <object
type="tElement"
>glossaryTermInLang</object
> information will be used.</p
><p
>Second, when both languages share the same glossary term, but the definitions are different (since they are in different languages), you will need to add a new <object
type="tElement"
>glossaryTermInLang</object
> element for the new language and key its term and definition in the new language. This probably rarely happens.</p

The key difference between just a single interlinear example and a list of interlinear examples is that the latter are indented and each interlinear unit is prefixed by an alphabetic letter. You may use any of the three kinds of interlinear examples shown in sections <sectionRef
sec="sExInterlinearSpace"
></sectionRef
>, <sectionRef
sec="sExInterlinearWrd"
></sectionRef
>, and <sectionRef
sec="sExInterlinearMorph"
></sectionRef
> above. I will illustrate using the first method for simplicity's sake.</p

type="tInTextExample"

><p
>One other thing to keep in mind while using the <object
type="tInstruction"
>Increase Table Size</object
> command is that it will make use of some of the existing material in the table. When it increases the number of header rows, it copies the first row in the table and then makes copies of that row until the total number of required header rows are present.. When it increases the number of non-header rows, it copies the last row in the table and then copies that row until the total number of required non-header rows are present. When it increases the number of columns, it copies the last column in the table and then copies that column until the total number of required columns are present.</p
><p
>Finally, please note that if the table you are working on already has row spans or column spans, the <object
type="tInstruction"
>Increase Table Size</object

id="nControllingTableBorderLines"
><p
>There are two reasons why it is not recommended. First and foremost, from my research in producing the default way of producing PDF, typesetters argue strongly against using any vertical lines at all in a table. In fact, they (practically) insist on only having some horizontal lines and that, sparingly. When I saw this, I was surprised. But then I found some linguistic books containing tables and, sure enough, these books followed this way - only horizontal lines, if any. I understand that the motivation for this is to make the tables easy to read. The more “noise” there is, the harder it is for the reader to quickly see the pertinent data.</p
><p

><li

><p
>You should see that this table cell has a different kind of border. There are a number of possibilities for this "magic formula" - I just randomly chose one. I'm afraid I'll need to refer you to a reference web site and you'll have to play around to get what you want. (If this feels like being thrown into the deep end here, well, it's because it is...).

>, especially the Layout section. Notice that there are some possibilities for borders on the left, right, top, and bottom. These are to control the various sides of the cell. You can have more than one of these, but you'll need to be sure to follow the proper syntax to get them to work:</p

>You can have footnotes in tables. <object
type="tXLingPap"
></object
>'s default behavior is to show the footnotes in the table just like it does footnotes/endnotes in prose. <indexedItem
term="iEndnoteInTh"
></indexedItem
>Please note that if the table is long, you will most likely not want to have any <object
type="tElement"
>endnote</object
> elements inside a <object
type="tElement"
>th</object
> element that forms a part of the header for the table. This is because if the table goes across a page boundary, the PDF formatting programs will automatically repeat the header information, footnote and all, on the next page. Thus, you will get the same footnote repeated once for every page the long table is on.</p
><p
>There are times, however, when you might need to have any footnotes in a given table show at the bottom of that table, not in the default location for general footnotes/endnotes. In such cases, the norm is not to use footnote numbers but rather a sequence of symbols such as an asterisk (*), a dagger (†), a double dagger (‡), a section symbol (§), and a paragraph symbol (¶). That is, the requirement is for the footnotes to stay with the table wherever that table appears and the footnote numbering is totally independent of the main footnote numbering elsewhere in the paper. How does one accomplish this with <object
type="tXLingPap"
></object
>?</p
><p
>The basic solution is to create a table that has the footnote material embedded in it by hand. Here are some suggestions on how to do that.</p
><ol

><li
>The <object

>type</object

type="tAttrValue"
>tFootnoteSymbolInTable</object

type="tAttrValue"
>tSuperscript</object
> <object
type="tElement"
>type</object
> element that comes with <object
type="tXLingPap"
></object
> and modify it to your liking/requirements. For example, it may be best to remove the <object
type="tAttribute"
>font-size</object
> attribute or to change its value so that the symbols are not too small.</li
><li
>The <object
type="tElement"
>type</object
> element <object
type="tAttrValue"
>tFootnoteInTable</object
> is used on the cells (i.e., <object
type="tElement"
>td</object
> elements) containing the body of the footnote. Set the <object
type="tAttribute"
>font-size</object
> attribute to the size you need the footnote body to be in. In some cases, this should be the same as regular footnotes; in other cases, it can be the same as the text in the table.</li
></ol
></li
><li
>Everywhere you need a footnote symbol in the body of the table, insert an <object
type="tElement"
>object</object
> element and set its <object
type="tAttribute"
>type</object
> attribute to <object
type="tAttrValue"
>tFootnoteSymbolInTable</object
>. Within this <object
type="tElement"
>object</object
> element, insert the symbol you need for this footnote. In some cases, the same footnote body applies to multiple places in the body of the table. Just repeat the same symbol for each of these (see <link

>http://www.press.uchicago.edu/dms/ucp/journals/jrnl-images/tbl_fg4.gif</link
> for an example; note the multiple uses of the single asterisk and the double asterisk; accessed on 5 June, 2015).</li
><li
>Add an extra row at the bottom of the table for each footnote body you need. See section <sectionRef
sec="sIncreaseTableSize"
></sectionRef

(Another hint if you have several footnotes: add one extra row, do the steps in 4 below for the first footnote body, and then increase the table size for the remaining footnotes. This will automatically copy the information you did in step 4 for all the new footnote rows.)</li

>Some publishers require one to put tables, charts and trees in special formatting items sometimes called “floats.” The idea is that where these items will appear in the published document will “float" depending on what is best as determined by the typesetter.<endnote
id="nFloat"
><p
>My assumption is that the goal is to save paper so they want the float to appear wherever it least affects the total number of pages of the document.</p
></endnote
> Personally, I am not a fan of floats. Whenever I am reading an article or book that has these, it is often the case that when a figure or table is referenced in the text, it is very hard to know where to look for the figure or table. Even though they are numbered, they typically do not appear very often so one does not know whether to look ahead or behind nor how far. It also is often the case that no list of figures or list of tables were provided, making it even more challenging to find the correct float.<endnote
id="nFloatReference"
><p
>At least with hyper-linked documents, one can follow the reference link to the figure or table. But once it is printed on paper, that advantage goes away.</p
></endnote

><p
><object

type="tElement"
>endnote</object

id="nXSLFOConverterNoFloats"
><p
>The reason is that the process that produces Word (and <object

></endnote
></p
><p
>Something else to keep in mind is that these floats are intended to occur relatively infrequently. There should be lots of text and/or examples and/or other tables, etc. between them. If you have many of these in a row, the <object

term="iInterlinearTextModularDocument"

>One is to create an interlinear text as a modular document. You can then make this text be part of more than one <object

><p
>The other way is to merely create the text within your current document. To do this, one can, say, perform an insert after command (e.g. press <object
type="tKey"

>One important, but easy to forget, issue is that you are actually tagging your data with these <object

>object</object

type="tElement"
>object</object
> element that is for the kind of thing it is as opposed to how you want it to format. This is especially challenging for those of us who have been using programs that show what we are keying in the way it is to appear on paper; we become conditioned to think in terms of formatting rather than in terms of the kind of item it is. By tagging it as a special object, if we (or someone else) ever decide to format these kinds of items differently, it is very easy to change - merely change the formatting information of the <object
type="tElement"
>type</object
> element. If we have merely tagged these as “bold” or “italic” or used some special color, however, we have to manually search through the document to figure out which ones to change.</p

>The main issue is that when one uses accented letters, the accented letter internally can sometimes be stored and represented in two or more possible ways. For example, it is possible that the file name on the disk uses a <indexedItem
term="iUnicodeDecomposed"
></indexedItem
>“decomposed” form (called NFD) so that an accented vowel, say, would consist of two Unicode characters: the vowel followed by an accent diacritic character. The URI produced via the <object

term="iUnicodeComposed"
></indexedItem
>“composed” form (called NFC) so that the accented vowel is a single Unicode character. While both of these forms will look the same to the human eye, the computer's internal representation will actually be different. Since computers are such precise and picky machines, the program will not see the two as being the same. It can thus be frustrating to a user when it looks like the names are the same, but the program won't find the file.</p

></object

></endnote
></p
><p
><indexedItem
term="iValidityTool"
></indexedItem
>When your file is saved and there is some such problem, you may also see the Validity tab open up on the right, in the same area where the Attributes tool is. For example, it might look like this:</p
><example
num="xValidityErrors"
><chart
><img
XeLaTeXSpecial="scaled='550'"

></img
></chart
></example
><p
>Unfortunately, the messages like the ones above in <exampleRef
letter="xValidityErrors"
num="xValidityErrors"
></exampleRef
> that the validity tool gives are not that easy to understand. The nice thing, though, is that the blue numbers enclosed in square brackets are hyperlinks to the place in your document where the problem is. If you have the red <img
src="resources/ValidityIconSchematron.png"
></img
> image showing, then these warning messages will have some suggested steps for how to fix the problem.</p
><p
>In <exampleRef
letter="xValidityErrors"
num="xValidityErrors"
></exampleRef

><ol
><li
>Error [1] is an instance where an id for an example, section, etc. has already been defined. These ids must be unique, so to have such a message is nice (I just wish the wording was clearer!).</li
><li
>Errors [2] and [3] are instances of the opposite: there is a reference element (e.g. <object
type="tElement"
>citation</object
>, <object
type="tElement"
>exampleRef</object
>, or <object
type="tElement"
>sectionRef</object
>, among others) which is referring to an id that does not exist. Because of this, when you process your <object
type="tXLingPap"
></object
> document, the reference will not be processed properly (if it can be processed at all). Once again, having this error reported is a good thing.</li
></ol
><p
>So to find out where an error is, click on the blue number enclosed in square brackets. The place should open up in the editor and it should be selected. (On rare occasions, clicking on the number will not show you the problem. When this happens, you can try and use the ugly "no style sheet" view. Clicking on the number should then take you to the element that has the problem. To use this view, use the menu item <object
type="tInstruction"
>View / 0 (no style sheet)</object
>. Then click on the number. To return to the nicer <object
type="tXLingPap"
></object
> view, use menu item <object
type="tInstruction"
>View / XLingPap</object

><p
>After you fix the errors (and do a save), the Validity tool area should become blank. You will probably then want to click on the Attributes Tool tab.<endnoteRef

(Why Windows 7 allowed duplicates, I have no idea.) The solution was to get a tool like TypoGraf to see what fonts are truly installed, find the duplicates, delete them, and re-install the one version of the font desired. TypoGraf can be obtained from <link
href="http://www.neuber.com/typograph/index.html"
>http://www.neuber.com/typograph/index</link

></indexedItem
>The default way of producing PDF, <object

></object

Sometimes, however, when there is an abbreviation, you do not want to have this extra wide spacing. You want the normal spacing used between words (word-spacing).</p
><p
>There are actually three cases where this can be an issue:</p
><ol
><li
>An abbreviation is used in the middle of a sentence (such as <object
type="tInTextExample"
>etc.</object
>). The normal output will use sentence-spacing here but you want word-spacing instead.</li
><li
>An abbreviation is used in the middle of a sentence and, in addition, you want to make sure that the line does not end after this abbreviation (such as the “Dr.” in <object
type="tInTextExample"
>Dr. Potts</object
>). The normal output will use sentence-spacing after the period but you want word-spacing instead.</li
><li
>An abbreviation is used at the end of a sentence and the letter before the period is a capital (such as in <object
type="tInTextExample"
>LSA.</object
>). The normal output will use word-spacing after the period but you want sentence-spacing instead.</li
></ol
><p
>For these relatively rare cases, you can make the output do what you want by inserting a special zero width character after the period and before the following space. Example <exampleRef
letter="xXeLaTeXSpaceAfterPeriod"
num="xXeLaTeXSpaceAfterPeriod"
></exampleRef

></endnoteRef
> click on the drop-down box and select the “0x2000 (General Punctuation)” section.</li

>Hover your mouse over the blank boxes near the top until you see the one that is for the zero width character needed as described in example <exampleRef

>. Click.</li
><li
>This inserts a single zero width character at the cursor. Be aware that you will not see anything different!</li
></ol
><p
>Please note that if you inadvertently insert two or more of these zero width characters, the output will come out in its default mode (i.e., it will not have the change you want). Be sure to only insert one of these zero width characters. You can always delete the characters there until you can see that no extra ones are present and then insert them again.</p
><p
>One final note: many, if not most, manuals of style will say that you should key a comma after the abbreviations <object
type="tInTextExample"
>i.e.</object
> and <object
type="tInTextExample"
>e.g.</object
>. This makes good sense because if you were to use the English equivalents of these abbreviations, chances are that you would use a comma after them. This means that for these two common abbreviations, if you use a comma after them, you will not need to do anything special. The <object

><p
>First, you need to install the (free) <object
type="tTool"

href="http://calibre-ebook.com/"
>http://calibre-ebook.com/</link

>Very Important</object
>: You must use the default location for storing your books in the Calibre Library. If you use some other location, <object
type="tXLingPap"
></object
> will not be able to find it and thus will not succeed in producing the EBook for you. Also, you may find that the EBook fails to be produced if the file name is long. Try to keep the name under 24 characters. While counting, a space counts as 3 characters as do some other non-A-Z or digit characters. If the name is too long, the EBook will fail to be produced.</p
><p
>For users of <object
type="tXLingPap"
></object
> on Mac OS X computers, you must also do another step before <object
type="tXLingPap"
></object
> will know that you have installed <object
type="tTool"
>Calibre</object
>. (This is for version 1.x of <object
type="tTool"
>Calibre</object
>; versions 2.x and 3.x do not need this additional step.) When you have <object
type="tTool"
>Calibre</object
> running, use <object
type="tInstruction"
>Preferences / Advanced / Miscellaneous</object
> and click on <object
type="tInstruction"
>install command line tools</object
>.</p
><p
>Second, this process only works when you have associated a publisher style sheet with your file. See section <sectionRef
sec="sFAQAssociatePublisherStyleSheet"
></sectionRef
>.</p
><p
>Finally, use the menu items <object

>F7</object

>Calibre</object
>. If so, it then starts a four step process to convert your document into an EBook in <object

type="tInTextExample"
>epub</object

type="tXLingPap"
></object
> will try and load the newly created EBook into <object
type="tTool"
>Calibre</object
>'s EBook viewer program.</p
><p
>If you wish to try and convert the resulting <object

>There are times when one may wish to have certain “chunks” of material excluded for a particular output of a given document. Other times, one will want to include these “chunks” of material for a different output. Ideally, one would not want to have to create two separate documents - one with the excluded material and one without.</p
><p
>Now <object
type="tXLingPap"
></object
> has a way to control which “chunks” of material, if any, should be excluded within a single document when producing an output. The basic idea is to tag any “chunk” material that might need to be excluded for some output with a particular content “type” that you have defined. Then you define a set of content choices where each choice indicates zero, one, or more of these content types. When you are ready to produce an output for the document, you select the choice that excludes the type(s) you want and the resulting output will have all material in the document except those “chunks” with the type(s) of that choice.</p
><p
>As an example, suppose you have a grammar for a minority language which includes some pedagogically-oriented material usually in the introduction of many sections and you also have some examples showing what the national language does. You may want four outputs for this depending on the intended audience: one with everything, one without the introductory material, one without the national language comparative examples, and one with neither the introductory material nor the national language comparative examples.</p
><p
>To make this happen, one would first create a <object
type="tElement"
>contentControl</object
> element. To insert a <object
type="tElement"
>contentControl</object

>If you wish, you can create a list of the ISO 639-3 codes that are used in a document. Just like references and citations, the idea here is that while the list of ISO 639-3 codes can be large, <object
type="tXLingPap"
></object
> will only show those that are actually used somewhere within the document. You can thus maintain a master file that has the set of languages (and their ISO 639-3 code and language names), include it in your document, and then, make a reference to an ISO 639-3 code in the list. Besides only including the ISO 639-3 codes actually used somewhere in the document, <object
type="tXLingPap"
></object
> will also create a hyperlink between the code and the actual code in the list of codes. Of course, the list will also include the language name of the code.</p
><p
>This master list of languages can also give the name of the language in multiple languages. So if you typically write your papers in either English or Spanish, say, you can maintain the list of language names in both languages. For a given paper, you indicate which language to use by setting the <object
type="tAttribute"
>iso639-3codelang</object
> attribute of the main <object

note="nAttributesToolReminder"
></endnoteRef
> to find and edit the <object
type="tAttribute"
>iso639-3codelang</object
> attribute. You will need to key in the id of one of the <object
type="tElement"
>language</object

type="tAttrValue"
>en</object
> for English, <object
type="tAttrValue"
>es</object
> for Spanish, or <object
type="tAttrValue"
>fr</object
> for French). If you do not set this attribute, then the first language name item found will be used. Also, if you inadvertently do not have an id for the language you selected, but you do have one for another language, then the first language name found will be used, too. See section <sectionRef

>Turning now to showing the ISO 639-3 codes in a glossary, one needs to insert a <object
type="tElement"
>glossary</object
> element in the back matter. One can then open up the <object
type="tElement"
>glossary</object
> element and type any prefatory material one might want (of course, one does not have to type anything). One then inserts the special <object
type="tElement"
>iso639-3codesShownHere</object
> element. Note that since this will be formatted as a table, it needs to go after or before a paragraph (<object
type="tElement"
>p</object
> element); it will not work to put it within a paragraph.</p
><p
>One should also change the <object
type="tAttribute"
>label</object
> attribute of the <object
type="tElement"
>glossary</object
> element to something like “ISO 639-3 Codes” so the title of this section does not say “Glossary.” It might look like this:</p

>There may be times when you want to write a document which will be in more than one language. Using content control (see section <sectionRef
sec="sContentControl"
></sectionRef
>) it was possible to create content types for each language. One would write each “chunk” item first in one language and then in the other. You would tag each “chunk” with its appropriate content type. The problem, though, was that there was not a way to create distinct title and label items for each language. For example, every chapter or section element has a <object
type="tElement"
>secTitle</object
> element, but there was not a way to indicate a portion of this title as being for only a particular language. Similarly, if one uses a <object
type="tElement"
>contents</object
> element or a <object
type="tElement"
>preface</object
> or <object
type="tElement"
>glossary</object
> element, there is a way to change the <object
type="tAttribute"
>label</object
> attribute on these to be in a particular language, but there was only one choice. In both of these cases, when one switched from one language to another, one had to manually change all titles and all labels from the one language to the other.</p
><p
>Now <object
type="tXLingPap"
></object
> has a way to use content control to determine separate titles and labels without having to manually change anything. As noted above, there are two kinds of items which would need this mechanism: titles and labels.</p

>, and <object

>History</secTitle
><p
>The name of this product, <object
type="tXLingPap"
></object
> is based on work by David Weber back in the mid 1980s: he wrote a <object
type="tTool"
>CC</object
> table for the old <object
type="tTool"
>ManuScripter</object
> program that was for linguistic documents. Since back then files were limited to six characters plus a three letter extension, he called it <object
type="tTool"
>LNGPAP</object
>. My work was based on XML, so I put an X in the front and added the i in Ling. The problem is that several people felt uncomfortable with the pap part since it reminded them of the PAP smear test ladies go through. So I changed it to <object
type="tXLingPap"
></object
>.</p
><p
>The first version was written in the summer of 2001. In fall of 2005, I learned about the <object
type="tXMLmindXMLEditor"
></object
> and began creating the configuration files for use with it. The first version only had web page output and only worked on Windows. In mid 2006, thanks to a suggestion by Gary Simons, I started adding output for XSL-FO which the <object
type="tRenderX"
></object
> program would convert to PDF.</p
><p
>In late 2007, I started adding the publisher style sheet capability.</p
><p
>In 2009, I made it work on Mac and Linux and also added the XeLaTeX way of producing PDF.</p
